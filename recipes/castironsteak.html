    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Recipe for a steak made in a cast iron pan. Seering the steak intially in the cast 
        iron pan and then finishing off in the oven is a great way to cook the steak to 
        your liking. Season with garnishments of your choice, below are a few we 
        recommend.</p>

         temperature, at least 15 minutes.</li>

         and black pepper.</li>
