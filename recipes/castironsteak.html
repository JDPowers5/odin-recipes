    <h2 class="header">Description</h2>
    <p>Recipe for a steak made in a cast iron pan. Seering the steak intially in the cast 
        iron pan and then finishing off in the oven is a great way to cook the steak to 
        your liking. Season with garnishments of your choice, below are a few we 
        recommend.</p>
